# Sentiment-Analysis-AI-Application-with-Flask
This repository contains the codes for a sentiment analysis AI application using Flask, which was done as part of the IBM Applied AI Professional Certificate. The folders [static](../main/static) and [templates](../main/templates) contain the JavaScript and HTML for the app's front-end, which were provided as a template in the course. The folder [SentimentAnalysis](../main/SentimentAnalysis) contains the package used to send texts to an IBM Watson NLP model to analyze the sentiments, and the code in [`test_sentiment_analysis.py`](../main/test_sentiment_analysis.py) is used to perform unit test to test the function in that package. The file [`server.py`](../main/server.py) contains the Flask back-end code for the app.
